The purpose of this prjoect is to inform and educate people on the many different types of green energy available to them and to allow them to document the changes they make to better reduce their carbon footprint.  This project contains a number of components including the Banner, NavBar, Footer, EnergyTile, and EnergyDetailView. To showcase these components and our journal we have the following routes: /, /green, and /journal. These routes each feature different components to serve different goals, our / route features a quick overview of what can be found on the rest of the pages as well as credits the team that built the project, /green features the most important part of the project, an assortment of green energy types displayed in interactive tiles that can be clicked to provide further information on each type of green energy. /journal features a journal in which users can enter updates about the changes they have made to be more green. We make use of state management in our Journal section to handle entries, inputs, and to ensure that the user is never left hanging while we wait for our async function to return it's promise.
